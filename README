INSTALLER

    A self-extracting installer is available (spacefm-x.x.x-installer.sh):
        https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tree/master/packages
            (To save a file, click on its filename and click 'View Raw')

    The installer requires the build dependencies listed below in BUILD.  If
    any dependencies are missing, examine the error, install missing packages,
    and try again.
       
    The installer MUST be run in a terminal.  It automatically builds and
    installs.  Run it like this:
    
        bash spacefm-x.x.x-installer.sh
        
    or to see options:
    
        bash spacefm-x.x.x-installer.sh --help

    To reinstall or upgrade, just run the latest installer again.


BUILD

1)  Install required build dependencies (below are Debian package names - 
    packages names on your distro may vary but should be similar):

        autotools-dev bash dbus desktop-file-utils libc6 libcairo2 libdbus-1-3
        libglib2.0-0 libgtk2.0-0 (>=2.24) libpango1.0-0
        libstartup-notification0 libx11-6 shared-mime-info intltool pkg-config
        libgtk2.0-dev libglib2.0-dev fakeroot libstartup-notification0-dev
        libdbus-1-dev libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libudev0 (>=143) libudev-dev
 
    NOTE: libgtk must be >= 2.24.  Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu 10.04 users
        may not be able to install SpaceFM due to repositories missing package
        libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0

    Also Recommended: eject, lsof, wget, ktsuss|gksu, udisks

    IF building with HAL support, you also need:
        hal libhal-dev libhal-storage-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libhal-storage1
        libhal1 libdbus-glib-1-2
    and with HAL you do NOT need: libudev0 libudev-dev

    IF disabling inotify support, you also need fam or gamin:
        fam|gamin libfam0|libgamin0 libfam-dev|libgamin-dev

    configure will report anything missing when you run it as shown below.
    
2)  Use these commands to download the SpaceFM tarball and build:

        # Download & Extract
        mkdir /tmp/spacefm-build && cd /tmp/spacefm-build
        wget -O spacefm.tar.gz https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tarball/master
        tar xzf spacefm.tar.gz
        cd IgnorantGuru-spacefm-*
        
        # Build & Install
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime > /dev/null
        sudo update-desktop-database -q
        
        # Remove Temporary Files
        cd / && rm -rf /tmp/spacefm-build

    NOTE: If configure reports missing dependencies, install them and run
    configure again before proceeding to make.

    NOTE: If hal support is desired (this will disable udisks support and will
    seriously limit device manager capabilities), add --enable-hal to the
    configure command above.

    NOTE: If you don't want to use the inotify kernel support and instead
    want fam or gamin to detect directory changes, add to configure:
        --disable-inotify
        
    NOTE: SpaceFM supports ktsuss, gksu, gksudo, gnomesu, kdesu, and xdg-su.
    To build with an additional custom su program ('/usr/bin/mysu' in this
    example), add:
        --with-preferable-sudo=/usr/bin/mysu  # to the configure command

    For general build information consult the INSTALL file.


BUILD DEBUG

If SpaceFM crashes on your system, you can help to correct this problem by
reporting it, including a full backtrace.

IF you are using Arch Linux, you can perform step 2 below, then use the AUR
spacefm-git package.

For other distros:

1)  Install build dependencies (see BUILD step 1 above).

2)  Install the 'gdb' GNU Debugger, and debugging symbols for gtk.  For example
    on Debian, this is done like this (packages on other distros should have
    similar names):

    apt-get install gdb libc6-dbg libglib2.0-0-dbg libgtk2.0-0-dbg librsvg2-dbg

3)  Use these commands to download the SpaceFM tarball and build:

        # Download & Extract
        mkdir /tmp/spacefm-build && cd /tmp/spacefm-build
        wget -O spacefm.tar.gz https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tarball/master
        tar xzf spacefm.tar.gz
        cd IgnorantGuru-spacefm-*
        
        # Build & Install
        CFLAGS='-ggdb -O1' STRIP='!strip' ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime > /dev/null
        sudo update-desktop-database -q
        
        # Remove Temporary Files
        cd / && rm -rf /tmp/spacefm-build

4)  Run spacefm with the debugger:

        gdb /usr/local/bin/spacefm
        
    In gdb, enter 'run' at the prompt.  SpaceFM will start.  When the crash
    occurs, gdb will freeze SpaceFM.  Return to the terminal running gdb and
    enter 'bt full'.  Provide the output with your detailed bug report at
        https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues
    
    NOTE: When SpaceFM is built this way, it may run more slowly.  Once you are
    done debugging, be sure to install a normal (optimized) build.


BUILD NEXT

The git 'next' branch of SpaceFM is a work in progress which eventually becomes
the next release version.  The next build is less stable in general, and
functions may be incomplete.  To build from this branch, install the required
build dependencies listed above in BUILD, then:

    # Download & Extract
    mkdir /tmp/spacefm-next && cd /tmp/spacefm-next
    wget -O spacefm-next.tar.gz https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tarball/next
    tar xzf spacefm-next.tar.gz
    cd IgnorantGuru-spacefm-*
    
    # Build, & Install
    ./autogen.sh   # pass desired configure options (if any) here to autogen.sh
    make
    sudo make install
    
    # Remove Temporary Files
    cd / && rm -rf /tmp/spacefm-next


CREATE DEB PACKAGE

To build a deb file of SpaceFM on your Debian-based distro:

1)  Install build dependencies (see BUILD section above) plus 'debhelper'.

2)  Use these commands to download and extract the SpaceFM tarball:

        mkdir /tmp/spacefm-build && cd /tmp/spacefm-build
        # Note: you can change "master" to "next" if you want the next branch:
        wget -O spacefm.tar.gz https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tarball/master
        tar xzf spacefm.tar.gz
        cd IgnorantGuru-spacefm-*

3)  IF hal support IS desired:

        cp debian/control-hal debian/control
        cp debian/rules-hal debian/rules

4)  Build package:  (the package files will appear in the parent directory)

        dpkg-buildpackage -b -uc
        cd .. && rm -rf IgnorantGuru-spacefm-* spacefm.tar.gz

5)  To install the package you built:

        dpkg -i spacefm*.deb


UNINSTALL

If you installed from a package, use your package manager to remove SpaceFM.
Otherwise, run these command AS ROOT:

    rm /usr/local/bin/spacefm /usr/local/bin/spacefm-auth
    rm -r /usr/local/share/spacefm
    rm /usr/local/share/pixmaps/spacefm.png
    rm /usr/local/share/pixmaps/spacefm-*.png
    rm /usr/local/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/spacefm.mo
    rm /usr/local/share/applications/spacefm*.desktop
    rm /usr/local/share/mime/packages/spacefm-mime.xml
    update-mime-database /usr/local/share/mime > /dev/null
    update-desktop-database -q
