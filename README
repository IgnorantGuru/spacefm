INSTALLER

    A self-extracting installer is available:
        https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tree/master/packages

    The installer MUST be run in a terminal.  It automatically builds and
    installs.  Run it like this:
    
        bash spacefm-x.x.x-installer.sh
        
    or to see options:
    
        bash spacefm-x.x.x-installer.sh --help

    The installer requires the build dependencies listed below in BUILD.  If
    any dependencies are missing, examine the error, install missing packages,
    and try again.
       
    To reinstall or upgrade, just run the latest installer again.


BUILD

1)  Install required build dependencies (below are Debian package names - 
    packages names on your distro may vary but should be similar):

        autotools-dev bash dbus desktop-file-utils libc6 libcairo2 libdbus-1-3
        libglib2.0-0 libgtk2.0-0 libpango1.0-0 libstartup-notification0
        libx11-6 shared-mime-info intltool pkg-config libgtk2.0-dev
        libglib2.0-dev fakeroot libstartup-notification0-dev libdbus-1-dev
        libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0
 
    NOTE: libgtk must be >= 2.24.  Debian Squeeze and Ubuntu 10.04 users
        may not be able to install SpaceFM due to repositories missing package
        libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0

    Also Recommended: udisks ktsuss|gksu wget eject lsof

    IF building with HAL support, you also need:
        hal libhal-dev libhal-storage-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libhal-storage1
        libhal1 libdbus-glib-1-2

    IF disabling inotify support, you also need fam or gamin:
        fam|gamin libfam0|libgamin0 libfam-dev|libgamin-dev

    configure will report anything missing when you run it as shown below.
    
2)  Extract spacefm-x.x.x.tar.xz and enter the directory containing the
    'configure' file.  The following commands will build and install as
    "/usr/local/bin/spacefm":
    
        ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime > /dev/null
        sudo update-desktop-database -q

    NOTE: If configure reports missing dependencies, install them and run
    configure again before proceeding to make.

    NOTE: If hal support is desired (this will disable udisks support and will
    seriously limit device manager capabilities), add --enable-hal to the
    configure command above.

    NOTE: If you don't want to use the inotify kernel support and instead
    want fam or gamin to detect directory changes, add to configure:
        --disable-inotify
        
    NOTE: SpaceFM supports ktsuss, gksu, gksudo, gnomesu, kdesu, and xdg-su.
    To build with an additional custom su program ('/usr/bin/mysu' in this
    example), add:
        --with-preferable-sudo=/usr/bin/mysu  # to the configure command

    For general build information consult the INSTALL file.


BUILD DEBUG

If SpaceFM crashes on your system, you can help to correct this problem by
reporting it, including a full backtrace.

1)  Install build dependencies (see BUILD step 1 above).

2)  Install the 'gdb' GNU Debugger, and debugging symbols for gtk.  For example
    on Debian, this is done like this (packages on other distros should have
    similar names):

    apt-get install gdb libc6-dbg libglib2.0-0-dbg libgtk2.0-0-dbg librsvg2-dbg

3)  Extract SpaceFM tarball and enter the directory containing 'configure'.

4)  Build spacefm with debugging flags:

        CFLAGS='-ggdb -O1' STRIP='!strip' ./configure
        make
        sudo make install
        sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime > /dev/null
        sudo update-desktop-database -q

5)  Run spacefm with the debugger:

        gdb /usr/local/bin/spacefm
        
    In gdb, enter 'run' at the prompt.  SpaceFM will start.  When the crash
    occurs, gdb will freeze SpaceFM.  Return to the terminal running gdb and
    enter 'bt full'.  Provide the output with your detailed bug report at
        https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues
    
    NOTE: When SpaceFM is built this way, it may run more slowly.  Once you are
    done debugging, be sure to install a normal (optimized) build.


BUILD NEXT

The git 'next' branch of SpaceFM is a work in progress which eventually becomes
the next release version.  The next build is less stable in general, and
functions may be incomplete.  To build from this branch, install the required
build dependencies listed above in BUILD, then:

    mkdir /tmp/spacefm-next && cd /tmp/spacefm-next
    wget -O spacefm-next.tar.gz https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/tarball/next
    tar -xf spacefm-next.tar.gz
    cd IgnorantGuru-spacefm-*
    ./autogen.sh   # pass any desired configure options here to autogen.sh
    make
    sudo make install
    cd / && rm -r /tmp/spacefm-next


UNINSTALL

As root:
    rm /usr/local/bin/spacefm /usr/local/bin/spacefm-auth
    rm -r /usr/local/share/spacefm
    rm /usr/local/share/pixmaps/spacefm.png
    rm /usr/local/share/pixmaps/spacefm-*.png
    rm /usr/local/share/locale/*/LC_MESSAGES/spacefm.mo
    rm /usr/local/share/applications/spacefm*.desktop
    rm /usr/local/share/mime/packages/spacefm-mime.xml
    update-mime-database /usr/local/share/mime > /dev/null
    update-desktop-database -q


CREATE DEBIAN PACKAGE

To build a deb file of spacefm:

1)  Install build dependencies (see BUILD INSTRUCTIONS above).

2)  Extract spacefm tarball and enter the directory containing 'configure'.

3)  IF hal support IS desired:

        cp debian/control-hal debian/control
        cp debian/rules-hal debian/rules

4)  Build package:

        dpkg-buildpackage -b

    The package files will appear in the parent directory.
