DESCRIPTION

    SpaceFM is a multi-panel tabbed file and desktop manager for Linux with
    built-in VFS, udev- or HAL-based device manager, customisable menu system,
    and bash integration. SpaceFM aims to provide a stable, capable file
    manager with significant customisation capabilities.


PACKAGES

    SpaceFM is included in most distro repositories.  To find packages, forum
    threads, and other info for your distro, see:
        https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/Distros

    For other distros, or to build with custom options, see INSTALLER below.


INSTALLER

    The easiest way to download and build SpaceFM is to use the net installer,
    which automates the instructions in this README. To download the installer:

    wget https://raw.github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/next/spacefm-installer
    # OR using curl:
    curl -L -o spacefm-installer \
            https://raw.github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/next/spacefm-installer

    To run the installer (MUST be run in a terminal):

        bash spacefm-installer

    Most users can press Enter to accept default values at both prompts.

    The installer will display dependencies for your chosen build.  If
    any dependencies are missing, examine the error, install missing packages,
    and try again.  See DEPENDENCIES below for reference.

    If you have already downloaded the source, the installer can be run from
    within the source directory to automatically build and install:

        ./spacefm-installer

    When SpaceFM is installed, the installer is also installed to /usr/bin.
    For automated options, run:  spacefm-installer --help

    To reinstall or upgrade, just run the installer again.  For example, to
    upgrade to the latest rolling release, just run:

        spacefm-installer --version=next --prefix=/usr

    To uninstall:   spacefm-installer --uninstall


DEPENDENCIES

    Install required build dependencies (below are Debian package names -
    packages names on your distro may vary but should be similar):

        autotools-dev bash build-essential intltool pkg-config fakeroot
        shared-mime-info desktop-file-utils libc6 libcairo2 libglib2.0-0
        libglib2.0-dev libpango1.0-0 libx11-6 libx11-6-dev libudev0 (>=143)
        libudev-dev libffmpegthumbnailer-dev

    Also, if using GTK2: libgtk2.0-0 (>=2.18) libgtk2.0-dev libgtk2.0-bin

    OR, if using GTK3:   libgtk-3-0 libgtk-3-dev libgtk-3-bin

    Also, if you want to use startup notification: libstartup-notification0-dev

    For optional dbus support: dbus libdbus-1-3 libdbus-1-dev

    RECOMMENDED: eject lsof wget udevil|pmount|udisks gksu|kdesu|ktsuss

    For additional mounting support: fuseiso curlftpfs jmtpfs gphotofs ifuse

    IMPORTANT: SpaceFM is highly integrated with bash and uses features of
    bash v4.  Attempting to substitute another shell for bash WILL cause
    feature breakage, even if not immediately apparent.  Use genuine bash.

    configure will report anything missing when you run it as shown below.


DOWNLOAD

    SpaceFM is distributed via Github:
        https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/releases

    First, make a temporary directory and enter it:

        mkdir /tmp/spacefm-build
        cd /tmp/spacefm-build

    To download a branch, particular version, or under-development commit, use:

    wget -O spacefm.tar.gz https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/archive/next.tar.gz

    The above example downloads the 'next' branch, which is SpaceFM's rolling
    release.  You can also substitute 'master' (stable release), a version
    number (eg '1.0.4'), or a commit (eg 1709b809) for 'next' in the above URL.

    Then, extract the archive, and enter the source directory:

        tar xzf spacefm.tar.gz && cd spacefm-*

    ALTERNATIVELY, instead of downloading the tarball with wget above, you can
    use git to clone the SpaceFM source repo, check signatures, and download
    upgrades.  See the USING GIT section further below.


INSTALL

    Use these commands to build and install:

        ./configure --prefix=/usr
        make -s
        sudo make install
        sudo update-mime-database /usr/share/mime > /dev/null
        sudo update-desktop-database -q
        sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor
        sudo gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/share/icons/Faenza

        # Remove Temporary Files
        cd / && rm -rf /tmp/spacefm-build

    If configure reports missing dependencies, install them and run configure
    again before proceeding to make.

    configure options for alternate builds:

    --with-gtk3
        By default, configure will use GTK2 if installed.  To force use of
        GTK3, add --with-gtk3.

        BE SURE to use a GTK3 theme which supports your CURRENT version of GTK3
        (no theme warnings should appear when spacefm is run in a terminal),
        or use Adwaita.

        PACKAGERS: Due to other desktop components, some users may require or
        prefer GTK2.  Please consider providing both spacefm-gtk2 and
        spacefm-gtk3 packages for your users.

    --disable-video-thumbnails
        Remove support for video thumbnails.  Omit libffmpegthumbnailer.

    --enable-hal
        Use HAL instead of udev.  Device manager functions are extremely
        limited.  Use of this build is only recommended if udev or eudev is not
        available.  SpaceFM HAL support is no longer actively developed, yet
        please report any build problems.
        Instead of libudev0 and libudev-dev, install:
            hal libhal-dev libhal-storage-dev libhal-storage1 libhal1
            libdbus-glib-1-2 libdbus-glib-1-dev dbus libdbus-1-3 libdbus-1-dev

    --sysconfdir=/etc
        Set the correct location of /etc on your system for installing
        /etc/spacefm/spacefm.conf.

    For additional configure options, see:  ./configure --help

    To run root commands, SpaceFM supports ktsuss, gksu, gksudo, gnomesu,
    kdesu, kdesudo, su-to-root, xdg-su, su, and sudo.  To configure an
    additional terminal or graphical su program see /etc/spacefm/spacefm.conf.
    Or, to build with an additional graphical su program ('/usr/bin/mysu' in
    this example), add:  --with-preferable-sudo=/usr/bin/mysu

    Note: When using older distros, enabling kernel polling may be required. If
    you insert a CD and SpaceFM still says 'no media', please see the ENABLE
    KERNEL POLLING section further below.


BUILD DEBUG

    If SpaceFM crashes or hangs on your system, you can help to correct this
    problem by reporting it, including a full backtrace.

    The easiest way to install a debug-compatible version of SpaceFM is using
    the installer.  See INSTALLER section above.  At the install options
    prompt, enter 1 for Debug.  Or run:  spacefm-installer --version=next 1

    OR, to manually build for debugging:

    1)  Install build dependencies for your build (see DEPENDENCIES above).

    2)  Install the 'gdb' GNU Debugger, and debugging library symbols.  For
        example on Debian (packages on other distros should have similar names):
        libc6-dbg libglib2.0-0-dbg libgtk2.0-0-dbg|libgtk-3-0-dbg librsvg2-dbg gdb

    3)  Follow the DOWNLOAD and INSTALL instructions above, substituting this
        configure command (add any other desired configure options):

            CFLAGS='-ggdb3' STRIP='!strip' ./configure --prefix=/usr

    4)  After completing the install, run spacefm with the debugger:

            gdb spacefm

        In gdb, enter 'run' at the prompt.  Or, to make gdb halt on any
        warnings, use 'run --g-fatal-warnings'.

        SpaceFM will start.  When the crash occurs, gdb will freeze SpaceFM.
        Or if SpaceFM hangs, press Ctrl-C in gdb to interrupt it, or in another
        terminal run:   killall -s KILL spacefm

    5)  In gdb enter:  thread apply all bt full

        Provide the output with your detailed bug report at
        https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/issues

    NOTE: When SpaceFM is built this way, it may run more slowly and use more
    memory.  Once you are done debugging, be sure to install a normal
    (optimized) build.


CREATE DEBIAN PACKAGE

    It's easy to create a binary deb package of SpaceFM on your Debian-based
    distro.  Please see the file distros/debian/README-DEBIAN.  Also note that
    there are SpaceFM packages in the official Debian repos and elsewhere:
    https://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm/wiki/Debian


UNINSTALL

    If you installed from a package, use your package manager to remove
    SpaceFM.  Or, use the installer to uninstall:

        spacefm-installer --uninstall

    Otherwise, run these commands AS ROOT:

        rm /usr/bin/spacefm /usr/bin/spacefm-auth /usr/bin/spacefm-installer
        rm -r /usr/share/spacefm     # this may remove SpaceFM plugins
        rm /usr/share/pixmaps/spacefm.png
        rm /usr/share/pixmaps/spacefm-*.png
        rm /usr/share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/spacefm.png
        rm /usr/share/icons/hicolor/*/apps/spacefm-*.png
        rm /usr/share/icons/Faenza/apps/48/spacefm.png
        rm /usr/share/icons/Faenza/apps/48/spacefm-*.png
        rm /usr/share/*/LC_MESSAGES/spacefm.mo
        rm /usr/share/applications/spacefm*.desktop
        rm /usr/share/mime/packages/spacefm-mime.xml
        update-mime-database /usr/share/mime > /dev/null
        update-desktop-database -q
        gtk-update-icon-cache -q -t -f /usr/share/icons/hicolor


USING GIT

    Instead of downloading a tarball to install SpaceFM, you can download some
    or all of the source repo using git.  See a tutorial for complete git
    instructions, but a few examples are provided below.

    To download just the source dir of a given branch, version, or commit, run:

        git clone --depth 1 -b next git://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm.git spacefm
        cd spacefm

    You can substitute any branch or version (eg 1.0.4) for 'next' in the above
    command.  To build and install, see INSTALL above, or run:
        ./spacefm-installer

    To pull in the latest changes to the next branch, run:

        git pull origin next

    Then you can proceed to INSTALL instructions to install the upgrade, or
    run:  ./spacefm-installer

    Although git already includes strong integrity protection, SpaceFM release
    tags are also signed with GPG key: ignorantguru AT gmx.com 0x01937621.
    To verify the GPG signature on a release (1.0.4 in this example), run:
        git tag -v 1.0.4

    To download the full SpaceFM source repo, with all branches and history:

        git clone git://github.com/IgnorantGuru/spacefm.git spacefm
        cd spacefm

    To find the sources for a particular branch (eg next or master), version,
    or commit (in this example, version 1.0.4), run:

        git checkout 1.0.4

    Then you can proceed to INSTALL instructions or run spacefm-installer.

    To create a tar.xz archive of the sources for version 1.0.4:

        git archive 1.0.4 --prefix=spacefm-1.0.4/ | xz > spacefm-1.0.4.tar.xz


ENABLE KERNEL POLLING

    Kernel polling, which allows for device and media change detection, is a
    newer feature of the Linux kernel and udev, so some distros don't yet have
    it enabled by default, but most already do.  If you insert a CD and SpaceFM
    still says 'no media', this is a symptom that kernel polling is not
    enabled.

    To use kernel polling, your Linux kernel may need to be 2.6.38 or newer,
    and udev may need to be version 173 or newer.

    TO DETERMINE IF KERNEL POLLING IS ENABLED:

        cat /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs
        cat /sys/block/sr0/events_poll_msecs

    If you get 0 or -1 from both of those commands, kernel polling may be
    disabled.

    TO ENABLE KERNEL POLLING PERMANENTLY (survives a reboot), add the
    following command to your /etc/rc.local file (anywhere before the
    'exit' line in that file):

        echo 2000 > /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs

    Any number between 2000 and 5000 (milliseconds) should be reasonable -
    the higher 5000 means poll every 5 seconds, which is less overhead but
    a little slower.

    OR pass this option to the kernel boot command line in grub:

        block.events_dfl_poll_msecs=2000

    OR add a udev rule to enable kernel polling on removable devices:

        echo 'ACTION=="add", ATTR{removable}=="1", \
              ATTR{events_poll_msecs}=="-1", ATTR{events_poll_msecs}="2000"' \
              > /etc/udev/rules.d/61-removable-storage-polling.rules

    A reboot will be required for the above changes to take effect, or...

    TO ENABLE KERNEL POLLING TEMPORARILY AND IMMEDIATELY, enable common
    polling for the block module:

        sudo bash -c 'echo 2000 > /sys/module/block/parameters/events_dfl_poll_msecs'

    OR you can enable polling just for a single device like this (/dev/sr0
    in this example):

        sudo bash -c 'echo 2000 > /sys/block/sr0/events_poll_msecs'

    This change should be immediate - media will be detected.  However, the
    above change will be lost when you reboot.

RELEASE

    For developers:  The 'release' script in the SpaceFM source dir is used by
    SpaceFM developers (or forks) to perform a release.

    To use this script, complete changes to the next branch (they don't have to
    be commited), then run: ./release

    Note the manual workflow items listed by the script before proceeding.

    The script will interactively perform a release of SpaceFM by increasing
    the version number, preparing the source dir for distribution, commiting
    the next branch, merging to master, signing the release tag, pushing
    master, starting the next version, and pushing next.  You must have
    permission to push to git's origin.  It also optionally pulls the wiki, and
    pushes gh-pages, if present.

    When the script is finished, master branch will contain the new release,
    next branch will be prepared for the next version, and Github will show the
    release tag in Releases.
