/**
 * SECTION: exo-binding
 * @title: Binding Properties Functions
 * @short_description: Functions used to bind two object properties together
 * @include: exo/exo.h
 * @see_also: <ulink url="http://library.gnome.org/devel/gobject/stable/">
 *            GObject Reference Manual</ulink>,
 *            <link linkend="exo-Extensions-to-GObject">Extensions to GObject</link>
 *
 * Binding properties is synchronizing values of several properties,
 * so that when one of the bound properties changes, the other
 * bound properties are automatically changed to the new value as
 * well. These functions eliminate the need to write property
 * change notification callbacks manually. It also increases the
 * reliability of your project as you don't need to repeat similar
 * code (and errors) manually.
 *
 * Both uni-directional and mutual
 * bindings are supported and you can specify functions to perform
 * explicit transformation of values if required. Multiple properties
 * can be bound together in a complex way and infinite loops are
 * eliminated automatically.
 *
 * For example, lets say, your program has a #GtkEntry widget that allows
 * the user to enter some text for the program, but this entry widget should
 * only be sensitive if a #GtkCheckButton is active.
 *
 * <example>
 * <title>Connecting a <structname>GtkCheckButton</structname> and a
 * <structname>GtkEntry</structname></title>
 * <programlisting>
 * {
 *   GtkWidget *button;
 *   GtkWidget *entry;
 *
 *   button = gtk_check_button_new_with_label ("Activate me");
 *   entry = gtk_entry_new ();
 *
 *   exo_binding_new (G_OBJECT (button), "active",
 *                    G_OBJECT (entry), "sensitive");
 * }
 * </programlisting>
 * </example>
 *
 * As you can see, all you need to do is to call one function to connect
 * the sensitivity of the entry widget with the state of the check
 * button. No need to write signal handlers for this purpose any more.
