The files in distros/debian/ may be used to build a binary deb package of 
SpaceFM for use on Debian-based distros (Lenny and later).  See the CREATE DEB
PACKAGE section in ../../README for step-by-step instructions.

Note that for newer Debian versions, some adjustments to the control file
(dependencies) may be necessary, or use official packages below.

For official Debian packages, please see Debian repositories:
